# Roberto il Pizzaiolo üçï

Our fearless CEO Roberto has been passionately running 3 pizzeria's in Northern California using only the freshest of ingredients. A crowd favorite, he only serves a classic Margherita pizza where ingredients are critical to the quality.

## Problemo

So what's the deal?

Every ingredient vendor has a different schedule, price, communication channel, and technical sophistication when it comes to ordering. Roberto is managing his entire ingredient ordering process in Excel ü§Ø. Last week his West Oakland spot was low-on-dough and had to turn down customer orders. Not ideal.

To make matters even more fun, Roberto wants to expand and **open 5 more pizzerias this year**‚Äîhis ordering problem is going to increase exponentially!

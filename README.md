# Roberto il Pizzaiolo üçï

Our fearless CEO Roberto has been passionately running 3 pizzeria's in Northern California using only the freshest of ingredients. As a crowd favorite, the classic Margherita pizza (where ingredients are critical to the quality) is the only pizza on the menu.

## Problemo

So what's the deal?

Every ingredient vendor has a different schedule, price, communication channel, and technical sophistication when it comes to ordering. Roberto is managing his entire ingredient ordering process in Excel ü§Ø. Last week his West Oakland spot was low-on-dough and had to turn down customer orders. Not ideal.

To make matters even more fun, Roberto wants to expand and **open 5 more pizzerias this year**‚Äîhis ordering problem is going to increase exponentially!

## Design Take-home Test
Design a one-page screen showing Roberto's daily dashboard for him to understand a few important updates:

1. In some type of schedule view, what's the next delivery he should be expecting? And what's the past deliveries he's received?
2. What's the latest for each individual vendor? Does he need to follow up with anyone to get updated information?
3. What's the current inventory? Can we use the existing excel workflow and bring it online to inform our ingredient forecasting?
